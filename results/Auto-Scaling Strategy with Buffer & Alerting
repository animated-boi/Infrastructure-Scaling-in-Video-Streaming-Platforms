## 🚀 Auto-Scaling Strategy with Forecast-Guided Buffer and Alerting

### Overview
This strategy simulates how infrastructure scaling can adapt to fluctuating video demand based on forecasted traffic. It uses LSTM_Univariate forecasts and introduces:

- 🔄 Dynamic resource allocation based on predicted views.
- ➕ A buffer of 0.5 units beyond forecasted requirements to handle minor spikes.
- 🚨 An alerting system to notify when resources are under- or over-provisioned.

---

### 🧮 Logic

- **Unit Capacity**: 1 unit supports 50 million views.
- **Buffer**: +0.5 unit added beyond required units.
- **Max Cap**: Optional ceiling of 1B views allocated.

---

### ⚠️ Alerts

- If actual_views > allocated_capacity → “Scale-Up Needed”
- If actual_views < 50% of allocated_capacity → “Scale-Down Opportunity”

---

### 📈 Visualization

The output plot includes:
- Actual views (blue)
- Forecasted views (orange)
- Allocated resource capacity (dashed line)
- Thresholds for scale-up and scale-down

This gives an intuitive view of how closely resources track demand.
